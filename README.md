###Need to add correct paths for both ghub_cox_alg.py

###Run ghub_cox_seperator.py first
###It will randomly seperate patients into test and validation datasets and perform cox subsampling 
###Will output intermediate files for last step in survival algorithm process


###Lastly run ghub_cox_alg.py
